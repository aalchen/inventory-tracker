# Minimize

## Reduce the clutter in your life

Do you ever feel like you have too much stuff? 

Do you forget what you own, only to buy the same thing twice by accident? 

Do you have a lot of useless junk laying around?

With *Minimize*, you can move towards a minimalist life. The only things you should own are things that actually :sparkles: spark joy :sparkles: for you! Inspired by Marie Kondo's **KonMari method**, this app will add some much needed organization in your life.

One person's trash is another one's treasure. Go on and sell that junk in your closet, and make some money too! 

*Minimize* will allow you to:
- keep track of your own belongings
- categorize each item
- record its status (keeping, selling, or sold)

Personally, I've realized that I have **so much stuff** collected over the years that I simply don't need. They're no longer useful to me, for one reason or another. Not to mention, it will be so much easier to move when I have no junk!  

I want to buy used when I can, and return things to the shared resource community when I can. I want to stop adding to the world's landfills. 

So go on, use *Minimize* so that you can live your best life.

Mother Nature will also thank you.
